Benchmarking 16S clustering methods on low biomass microbiome data

This repo contains the code used for the analysis presented in **Performance of microbiome sequence inference methods in environments of varying biomass**. This study benchmarked selected 16S rRNA clustering methods on high and low microbial biomass 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. 

**Motivation:** Sequence clustering is one of the initial and critical processing steps in 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies. Historically, this was completed using operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering methods. Recently, newer methods have been developed which overcome come limitaions of OTU clustering algorithms. These methods allow for clustering / resolution of exact sequence variants and are commonly refered to as amplicon sequence variant (ASV) methods.
